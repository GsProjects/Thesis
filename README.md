Can data analysis techniques be applied to historical data to provide quantitative short term weather predictions?


The purpose of this study was to determine if data analysis and machine learning techniques could be applied to historical data to generate short term weather forecasts. An analysis of existing literature showed the most common approach was to treat numerical weather prediction as a classification problem. The approach taken in this study was to treat it as a regression problem to provide precise values for the weather forecasts as opposed to a range of values or a textual description. Numerous engineered features were trialled with a select few improving on the models performance. Finally, a model was created that combined the raw features with the best of the engineered features and validated on a test set containing observations with rainfall values greater than 0.
